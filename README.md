# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
   The project is to design a mobile/web application of your choosing. Concepts in the course must
   be used and noted on presentations. The project must make use of the 3-tier architecture (data,
   service, and presentation layers) or a similarly complex architecture. You will be expected to
   discuss challenges (scalability, performance, etc...) related to your specific application. Any
   programming language and framework may be used as long as they are appropriate for each
   layer. The project may be completely software based and must be presented as a demonstration.

# Plan (~10%): DONE
   5-minute PowerPoint presentation                                               
   Explain which framework you will use for your app and why.                     
   Give a clear explanation of milestones and timeline to complete your project.  

# Progress Presentation(~30%): IN PROGRESS
   8-minute PowerPoint presentation, minimum 5 slides;                                          
   Give an overview of your application so far. Explain the main functions/classes, and give     
   examples of problems that can be solved using the software. Show and explain example code    
   which implements your application. Discuss the major tasks that still need to be completed.  
   
# Final Presentation(~60%):
   12-minute PowerPoint presentation and demo, minimum 8 slides;
   Describe your program and include a demo. Describe how you utilized your framework to
   implement your program in a unique way. What were some of the difficulties you encountered?
   What are the limitations of your framework? Possible future improvements?
